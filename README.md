<p1>Hello,this is my repository where I will keep all of my solution and project to the course of 1 of this Advance Machine Learning Speclization. These projects and assignments are quite challenging and diverse therefore the purpose of this repository is to help everyone who will be taking this speclization. I will make seprate repository for each course in this speclization. The main link to this speclization is: <a href='https://www.coursera.org/specializations/aml#courses'> Advance Machine Learning Speclization by National Research University Higher School of Economics</a> and the link to the course-1 is <a href='https://www.coursera.org/learn/intro-to-deep-learning'>Introduction to Deep Learning</a>
  
 <p2>The goal of this course is to give learners basic understanding of modern neural networks and their applications in computer vision and natural language understanding. The course starts with a recap of linear models and discussion of stochastic optimization methods that are crucial for training deep neural networks. Learners will study all popular building blocks of neural networks including fully connected layers, convolutional and recurrent layers. </p2>
